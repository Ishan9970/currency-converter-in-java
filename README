**Currency Converter (Limited Currency Support)**

This Java application provides a simple currency converter, allowing users to convert amounts between specific currencies. 
However, it's essential to note that this converter supports only a predefined set of currencies. The available currency pairs include:
- **USD (United States Dollar)**
- **KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar)**
- **BHD (Baharaini Dinar)**
- **CHF (Swiss Franc)**
- **AUD (Australian Dollar)**
- **INR (Indian Rupee)**
If you need to convert between other currencies not listed above, you'll need to extend the codebase by adding additional currency exchange rates. 
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements. Happy converting! 😊🌍💱
