## **⚙️ How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **User Input** – Enter the amount and select the source & target currency.  
2️⃣ **Conversion Logic** – Uses predefined exchange rates to calculate the converted amount.  
   - **Example:** USD → KWD = Amount × 0.31, KWD → USD = Amount × 3.27  
3️⃣ **Validation** – Checks for invalid inputs and displays errors if necessary.  
4️⃣ **Reset & Exit** – Users can reset inputs or exit the program easily.

## **🛠️ How I Built This Project?**  
- **Java Swing** – Designed a simple GUI with buttons, text fields, and dropdown menus.  
- **Predefined Exchange Rates** – Applied static conversion values for instant calculations.  
- **Error Handling** – Ensured smooth user experience by handling invalid inputs.

## **⚠️ Limitations**  
📌 **Fixed Currency Support:** Works only for the six predefined currencies.  
📌 **Static Exchange Rates:** Rates do not update in real time. Consider integrating an API for live rates.
